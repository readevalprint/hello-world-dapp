# Hello World

This application demonstrates simple name registration using the Eris Decerver
and IPFS.  No blockchains nor smart contracts are employed (yet).

Requirements:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

Begin by running the `test.sh` script to make sure everything's working.

The application communicates with the Decerver using the IPFS protocol.  It is expected that this will be replaced with an Eris protocol in the future.

## Development

1.  Open a shell in the `source` directory and leave it open.  Run the following commands:
1.  `npm install`
1.  `npm run build`
1.  `develop.sh`.  It will start a server container and a test container.
1.  See the dapp by opening `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
1.  Whenever you make a change to a JavaScript file (such as `HelloWorld.js`), you need to re-bundle it before you can see the change reflected in the browser.  Do this by re-running the command `npm run build` and then refresh your browser.
